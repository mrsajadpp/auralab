# Sreya

Sreya is a lightweight npm package for storing and managing data using JSON files as collections. It provides simple and efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for working with collections stored locally on your file system.

## Installation

You can install Sreya via npm:

```bash
npm install auralab
```

## Usage

### Importing the Package

```typescript
import * as auralab from 'auralab';
```

### Connecting to a Database

Before using any CRUD operations, you need to connect to a database. This operation creates a directory for your database if it doesn't exist and retrieves a list of existing collections.

```typescript
await auralab.connect('mydatabase');
```

### Creating a Collection

You can create a new collection using the `create` function. If the collection already exists, this function will return a message indicating that the collection already exists.

```typescript
auralab.collection.create('mycollection');
```

### Finding Data in a Collection

You can retrieve the data stored in a collection using the `find` function. This function returns an array of objects representing the data in the collection.

```typescript
const data = auralab.collection.find('mycollection');
```

### Inserting Data into a Collection

To add new data to a collection, use the `insert` function. This function automatically generates a unique `_id` for the new data before insertion.

```typescript
const newData = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
await auralab.collection.insert('mycollection', newData);
```

### Updating Data in a Collection

You can update existing data in a collection using the `update` function. Provide a key-value pair to match the item to update and the new data.

```typescript
const newData = { name: 'Jane', age: 25 };
await auralab.collection.update('mycollection', { key: 'name', value: 'John' }, newData);
```

### Removing Data from a Collection

To remove an item from a collection based on a key-value pair, use the `remove` function.

```typescript
await auralab.collection.remove('mycollection', { key: 'name', value: 'John' });
```

### Destroying a Collection

You can delete a collection and its associated JSON file using the `destroy` function.

```typescript
await auralab.collection.destroy('mycollection');
```
